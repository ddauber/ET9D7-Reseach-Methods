`Short description of what the book intends to achieve`

## Install the companion package

If you want to take full advantage of this book, I strongly recommend to install the companion R package: [r4np](https://github.com/ddauber/r4np). It includes
- functions to get you up and running more quickly
- lots of datasets which are used in the book
